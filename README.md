# React-ChatBot
This is a lightweight chatbot interface built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The design mimics a typical messaging app layout, supporting user and bot messages with avatar icons. While not a full React-based app, it serves as a minimalist prototype for chatbot interaction design.
